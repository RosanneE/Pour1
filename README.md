- **Scope:** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?


- **User Stories:** Who is your user? What features will your app have?
- **Wireframes:** Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a *paper prototype* to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.
- **Data Models:** Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
- **Milestones:** Divide your work into parts - the most essential features for your MVP, features that are important but not essential, and features that can be saved for a later iteration. Create 3-5 major milestones with dates outlining when you expect essential features will be done.
- **Feasibility Study (optional):** If you're using an external API or scraping a website, make sure you can get that data. If you're using a new language, framework, or tool, go through its getting started tutorial. ***We will ask to see your results.***
